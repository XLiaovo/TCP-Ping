# TCP Ping Utility

The TCP Ping Utility is a simple Python script that allows you to test the connectivity and latency to a target server using the TCP protocol. It accomplishes this by attempting to establish a connection to the specified host and port and measuring the round-trip time.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter (**python TCP-Ping.py**).
2. Enter the target domain or IP address when prompted.
3. Enter the target port number when prompted.
4. The script will start continuously testing the connection to the target host and displaying the results, including success messages with latency and error messages for timeouts or connection issues.
5. To stop the testing, press **Ctrl+C**.
